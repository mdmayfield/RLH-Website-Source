# Example .gitignore file, as used by me for my particular development setup on OSX
# Rename this file to .gitignore to use it.
# Leave comments in or delete if you want a minimalist .gitignore

#RULES
# Ignore system generated .DS_Store files [only required if developing on OSX]
.DS_Store
# Ignore everything in 'DEV' directory [Allows me to keep local development work in same dir. as working site]
# Backslash to escape leading space because dir is actually called ' DEV' [so it floats to top in dir. listing]
\ DEV/*
# Don't upload content of public dir. It is generated automatically when 'hugo' or 'hugo server' is run, anyway.
# Won't someone think of the bandwidth!
public/
