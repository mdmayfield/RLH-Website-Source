From the "Coolest Things Ever" Department comes this memo:  Run Like Hell is collaborating with the Twin Cities Ballet of Minnesota in a rock ballet performance of Pink Floyd's The Wall album!  We have had several conversations with the folks at Twin Cities Ballet and they are some of the most amazing people.  Very cool.  Very creative. This will be the first time that The Wall will be performed as a rock ballet in the United States, and we are very honored to have been asked to be the band to perform the music for them.

It looks like the show will be opening at the Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts in March, 2018.  We are in talks about performing the show in a few cities in the midwest. Stay tuned for details!
