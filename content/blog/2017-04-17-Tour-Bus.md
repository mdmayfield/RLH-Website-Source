We purchased a tour bus from Junior Trejo from the Westside band.  They used this as one of their tour busses, and it already has a lof of custom work done on it like a generator, blacked out windows for the sleeping section, a refrigerator, microwave, flat screen TV, etc.  There are going to be a lot of good times driving from show to show in this thing.  It will save us a fortune in hotels and make sure that everyone arrives at each show safely and on-time.
